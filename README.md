# YoutubeDataAnalysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes YouTube video engagement data using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The goal is to transform time-series data (e.g., video views over time) into the frequency domain to identify periodic trends and patterns in audience engagement.As additional,this project shows comparing of Youtube subscriber counts and views count.

Features
Extracts YouTube video data (views, subscribers, etc.).
Applies FFT to convert time-based data into frequency components.
Visualizes the frequency spectrum to detect patterns.
Helps in understanding seasonality and periodic trends in video engagement.
